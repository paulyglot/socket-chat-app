This is code is for a very simple chat application in response to a technical interview takehome assignment.

Please follow instructions to clone remote repository to your computer for chat application interaction:

TO CLONE AND GET APPLICATION READY

1. Got to a local directory on your computer, and in terminal run:

    > git clone https://github.com/paulyglot/socket-chat-app.git

2. In terminal, change directories to socket-chat-app (eg. cd socket-chat-app)

3. In terminal, run:

    > npm install

4. In terminal, run:

    > npm start  

TO TEST APPLICATION

5. Proceed to your choice of browser and enter localhost:3000 to load chat application locally.

6. Open another supported browser unlike your first (e.g first browser Chrome, second browser Safari), and again enter localhost:3000 to see your chat appear in both browsers instantaneously.

7. Test messenger by typing into prompt box at bottom of either browser page.


 Next steps with my takehome chat-creation assignment:
 
  1. I would next implemented the user is typing functionality. 
  
  2. Broadcast to all users to show when someone connects or disconnects.
  
  3. Add user name functionality to make the chatroom easier to read and look back at.
